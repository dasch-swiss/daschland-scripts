CH_001,Alice,Alice,Alice,Alice,"Alice is a young English girl. She is the main protagonist of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There. She is a curious, imaginative, and bold young girl who finds herself in bizarre, dreamlike worlds filled with nonsense and eccentric characters.

Alice is a seven-year-old girl in Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland and slightly older in Through the Looking-Glass.
She follows the White Rabbit down a rabbit hole, leading her into Wonderland, where she experiences strange adventures and meets absurd characters.
In the Looking-Glass world, she plays through a giant chess game, moving from pawn to queen.

The beautiful pictures of Alice, drawn by John Tenniel, were inspired by Mary Hilton Badcock, the daughter of the Dean of Ripon. Although she was suggested as a model, it's not clear if Tenniel fully took this suggestion *alice-in-wonderland.net*.",,R_01,Curiouser and curiouser!,"In the digital wonderland of DaSCHland, Alice is reimagined as a spirited young explorer with radiant Indonesian features, her hair partly discoloured in bold streaks and styled into sharp, playful spikes that reflect her daring spirit. Her deep-set eyes, framed by thick lashes, are pools of curiosity—always scanning, always questioning. She wears a sleek cobalt-blue tunic etched with shifting patterns of code, a modern twist on the classic pinafore, and her boots are made for navigating both archives and algorithms.

Alice’s journey through DaSCHland is one of transformation and discovery. She is no longer just a curious girl—she is a digital native, dancing effortlessly between realms of metadata and memory, seamlessly blending analog tales with modern technology. She engages with whimsical characters: cracking semantic riddles with the White Queen, debating logic with a data-savvy Humpty Dumpty, and joining immersive banquets where narratives render themselves in augmented reality.

What defines Alice most is her inquisitive mind and adaptability. Each interaction deepens her understanding—not only of the strange world around her but also of the powerful ways in which digital infrastructures can animate literature, culture, and memory. She becomes a bridge between the old and the new, the textual and the virtual. In DaSCHland, Alice doesn’t just follow a rabbit hole—she codes her own path forward, illuminating how technology can turn curiosity into connection, and data into storytelling.",Alice,"I_003, I_004, I_005, I_006, I_007, I_008, I_009, I_010, I_011, I_012, I_014, I_015, I_021, I_022, I_023, I_025, I_029, I_030, I_032, I_034, I_035, I_040, I_042, I_043, I_045, I_046, I_047, I_049, I_052, I_053, I_055, I_056, I_060, I_061, I_066, I_067, I_068, I_070, I_071, I_072, I_076, I_077, I_078, I_079, I_080, I_081, I_082, I_084, I_085, I_086, I_087, I_089, I_090, I_091, I_092","Adventure, Journey, Exploration, Identity, Personal Growth, Transformation, Surrealism, Imagination, Contradiction, Logic, Paradoxes, Wordplay, Wisdom, Reflection","Noémi Villars-Amberg, Daniela Subotic"
CH_002,White Rabbit,Weisses Kaninchen,Lapin blanc,Coniglio bianco,"The White Rabbit is a nervous, hurried character who serves as Alice’s initial guide into Wonderland.
He is first seen checking his pocket watch and exclaiming, “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” before disappearing down the rabbit hole.
He works as a servant for the Queen of Hearts and is terrified of her temper.
He mistakes Alice for his housemaid, Mary Ann, in Chapter 4 and panics when she grows giant inside his house.

The White Rabbit is always late, which is a nod to Oxford time. At Oxford, especially at Christ Church, where Carroll used to teach, events often start five minutes after the scheduled hour *source: alice-in-wonderland.net*.",alice-in-wonderland.net,R_01,Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!,"In DaSCHland, RabbIT is a dazzling reinvention of the classic White Rabbit from Alice in Wonderland, seamlessly blending Victorian elegance with cutting-edge cybernetics. Serving as Alice’s ever-alert companion and digital guide, RabbitIT retains the essential traits of urgency, precision, and insight, but in this world of structured data and semantic layers, his role is transformed into something far more sophisticated.

Physically, RabbIT stands upright with the poise of a seasoned archivist, his lean white-furred frame outfitted in a digitally enhanced tweed waistcoat, woven with subtle glowing circuit patterns. The waistcoat pulses gently with his neural interface, reacting to environmental stimuli and query processing. At his chest hangs a pocket watch—now a circular holographic interface, flickering with layered timestamps, metadata clusters, and time-sensitive DaSCH queries. His bowtie spins slowly when system queries are active, an eccentric flourish of his old-world charm. His large, expressive eyes shimmer with augmented overlays, capable of scanning artifacts and projecting layered contexts from DaSCH’s repositories.

Perched before him is a suspended 3D hologram map of DaSCHland, a stunning lattice of interlinked domains, encoded landscapes, and floating literary landmarks. The hologram emits a soft blue luminescence as it rotates in mid-air, constantly updating with Alice’s position, temporal metadata overlays, and cross-referenced paths. With one paw extended, RabbIT manipulates the projection with delicate swipes and taps, zooming into sections like the Archive Gardens, the Textual Maze, or the Metadata Mountains. His ears twitch responsively as he receives real-time updates—reminders from calendrical entries in narrative timelines or system-generated alerts about data anomalies in literary zones.

Despite the cold efficiency of his AI enhancements, RabbIT exudes warmth, purpose, and a touch of eccentricity. He speaks with clipped precision but never lacks empathy, especially when guiding Alice through the cognitive dissonance of encountering Victorian poetry encoded in blockchain hashes or unraveling ontological puzzles disguised as riddles.

RabbitIT is not merely a guide; he is a bridge—between past and future, literature and logic, story and structure.

CH_003,Caterpillar,Raupe,Chenille,Bruco,"The Caterpillar is a calm, philosophical, and slightly rude blue creature who smokes a hookah while speaking with Alice.
He questions Alice’s identity, repeatedly asking, “Who are you?”, which confuses her.
He gives cryptic advice, telling Alice that eating different parts of a mushroom will make her grow or shrink.

The text describes the Caterpillar as blue ('a large blue caterpillar').",,R_01,Who are YOU ? ,"The Cyberpillar: A Guardian of Digital Wisdom

In the surreal, data-drenched realm of DaSCHland, the Cyberpillar is reimagined as an enigmatic digital sage, embodying both the contemplative nature of his original counterpart and a profound connection to the historical archives of the DaSCH repository. This evolved figure merges organic elegance with digital sophistication, presenting a living metaphor for the intersection of tradition and technology.

Physically, the Cyberpillar is a mesmerizing presence. His elongated, sinuous body shimmers with an iridescent palette of deep indigo and circuit-board green, subtly pulsing with streams of luminescent data like veins of living code. Along his back, glowing runes and historical glyphs scroll continuously, reflecting the living memory of the archive. His six arms are slender and dexterous, capable of gesturing through holographic interfaces with graceful precision. Perched atop a bioluminescent mushroom, his favorite resting place, he curls languidly as he exhales slow puffs of data mist that take the form of questions, quotes, or riddles. His eyes—multi-faceted like a philosopher’s kaleidoscope—seem to hold centuries of contemplation and layered meanings.

But this mushroom is no ordinary fungus; it functions as a multimedia data terminal, its gills glowing with embedded touch-responsive panels and holographic projectors. When Alice approaches with a query or philosophical dilemma, the mushroom blooms into an interactive library—scrolls unfurl, manuscripts materialize, and time-lapse projections of historical narratives fill the air. It becomes a tactile manifestation of epistemological discovery.

Intellectually, the Cyberpillar is a mentor of paradoxes. He speaks in puzzles and metaphors, threading together insights from ancient manuscripts, Enlightenment philosophy, and metadata visualizations with ease. His calm, sonorous voice delivers wisdom like a meditative mantra, always inviting Alice to think deeper, not faster. Every conversation with him is a crossroads of logic and mystery—he challenges her with recursive questions, historic parallels, and speculative thought experiments drawn from the archives of humanity.

True to his origins, the Caterpillar’s ability to transform remains, but now it represents more than a change of shape—it symbolizes the evolution of knowledge. When he metamorphoses, he becomes an ephemeral cloud of archived voices and interconnected texts, illustrating how data is not static but alive, growing, and reshaping itself across time and inquiry.

The Caterpillar of DaSCHland is not merely a character. He is a threshold guardian, a keeper of intellectual metamorphosis, a reminder that in this world where past and present are digitized and entangled, every question is a portal—and every answer, a transformation.",Cyberpillar,I_015,"Identity, Personal Growth, Wisdom, Reflection, Transformation, Surrealism, Imagination","Noémi Villars-Amberg, Daniela Subotic"
CH_004,Mad Hatter,Verrückter Hutmacher,Chapelier fou,Cappellaio Matto,"The Mad Hatter is a tea-obsessed, eccentric character who hosts the Mad Tea Party with the March Hare and the Dormouse.
He is called “mad” because Time has punished him by stopping time at 6 o’clock, meaning it is always tea-time for him.
He loves riddles and wordplay, famously asking Alice: “Why is a raven like a writing desk?”—a riddle with no real answer.
He appears again at the trial of the Knave of Hearts, where he nervously testifies before the Queen of Hearts.

In 'Through the Looking-Glass', the Hatter returns in the form of the Anglo-Saxon messenger 'Hatta'.

Contrary to popular belief, Lewis Carroll never referred to the Hatter as 'the Mad Hatter' in the story. He simply called him 'the Hatter'.
The phrase 'mad as a hatter' was common in Carroll's time, probably because hatters actually did go mad, as the mercury they used sometimes gave them mercury poisoning *source: alice-in-wonderland.net*.",alice-in-wonderland.net,R_01,Why is a raven like a writing-desk?,"The Archival Madcap of DaSCHland

In DaSCHland, the Mad Hatter is no longer merely a vessel of nonsensical charm—he has been reborn as an eccentric AI hybrid, a living node in a sprawling archive of historical memory and literary brilliance. His signature tea parties are now hyper-interactive data salons, held in a holographic garden under bioluminescent trees, with flowers that whisper metadata and vines that weave citations.

He is physically striking:
With untamed copper-red hair, glowing azure eyes enhanced by augmented reality lenses, and a high-collared nano-fabric suit patterned with evolving circuit motifs, he stands out like a glitch in time. His iconic top hat, oversized and polished obsidian-black, acts as an interactive HUD, projecting layers of literature, history, and puzzles into the air like auroras of intellect.

Each porcelain teacup shimmers with liquid light—streams of data flowing in micro-encoded ribbons. Each slice of cake is a dense block of semi-sweet syntax, digestible chunks of digitized wisdom.

But it’s not just for show. The Hatter challenges his guests with riddles, each unlocking another layer of DaSCHland’s storied repository.

CH_005,Cheshire Cat,Grinzekatze,Chat du Cheshire,Stregatto,"The Cheshire Cat is a mischievous, grinning cat who gives philosophical advice to Alice.
He has the ability to disappear and reappear at will, sometimes leaving only his grin behind.
He guides Alice, explaining the madness of Wonderland and telling her “We’re all mad here.”
He later appears at the Queen’s croquet game, where his floating head confuses the King and Queen of Hearts.
He serves as a guide for Alice, offering riddles and cryptic advice but never direct answers.

The reason for Carroll naming this character 'Cheshire Cat' is unclear: 
'To grin like a Cheshire Cat' was a common phrase in Carroll's day. 
It may have originated from a sign painter in Cheshire who painted grinning lions on the sign-boards of inns in the area.
Another source is the 'Alice Window' in Christ Church, Oxford, where you can see three grinning animals at the top of the Liddell's family arms. 
Cheshire cheeses were also once molded in the shape of a grinning cat *alice-in-wonderland.net*.",alice-in-wonderland.net,R_01,We’re all mad here. I’m mad. You’re mad.,"In the imaginative world of DaSCHland,The Quantum Cat (formerly known as the Cheshire Cat) emerges as a particularly compelling digital entity—equal parts guide, enigma, and interface. Retaining his iconic mystery and mischievous wit, he is now reimagined as a fully cybernetic being: a shimmering construct composed of translucent data fractals, his fur constantly shifting like a mosaic of living code. His body pulses gently with a luminous teal glow, occasionally phasing in and out of visibility as if he were woven from pure algorithmic ether.

Most striking is his grin—not made of teeth, but of interlaced glowing network filaments, forming a curved mesh of light that pulses with embedded glyphs and data nodes. This “smile” acts as a user interface to the DaSCH repository, allowing users to engage with metadata, digital records, and archival information simply by interacting with it. His eyes, sharp and angular, gleam with geometric complexity, constantly scanning, indexing, and offering contextual prompts as Alice wanders deeper into the digital dreamscape.

The Quantum Cat’s interactions with Alice are as paradoxical as they are enlightening. He speaks in riddles laden with metadata metaphors and philosophical inquiries, challenging her understanding of identity, permanence, and the nature of knowledge in the digital age. He offers guidance not by pointing to obvious solutions, but by subtly nudging her toward interpretive discovery, forcing her to think like a researcher navigating the layered ontology of a vast, interconnected archive.

His ability to phase in and out of digital visibility—sometimes leaving behind only a trace glow or a fading strand of binary code—mirrors the fluid, often elusive presence of information in contemporary digital ecosystems. In DaSCHland, where data can be simultaneously omnipresent and hidden beneath layers of abstraction, The Quantum Ca becomes a living metaphor for the state of digital memory: fragmented, refracted, yet full of potential insight.

Ultimately, this version of the Cheshire Cat is far more than a whimsical companion. He embodies the transformative power of digital technology to reshape not only narratives but the very nature of character interaction within virtual realms. As Alice journeys through DaSCHland’s datascapes—past holographic trees, algorithmic rivers, and libraries suspended in quantum mist—the Cat remains a constant reminder of the enigmatic, playful, and ever-shifting nature of the digital world she explores.",The Quantum Cat,"I_021, I_023, I_024, I_031","Wisdom, Mystery, Reflection, Madness, Irony, Surrealism, Imagination, Paradoxes","Noémi Villars-Amberg, Daniela Subotic"

She is tyrannical, irrational, and quick to anger, though her executions are never actually carried out (likely because the King of Hearts quietly pardons everyone).
She hosts a chaotic croquet game, where flamingos are used as mallets and hedgehogs as balls.

Carroll wrote the following about the Queen of Hearts:

The Data Queen’s realm in DaSCHland is a place where order intersects with the whimsical laws of Wonderland, making her both a guardian of traditional narratives and an enforcer of the digital world's unique logic. Her commands and decrees can instantly alter the landscape or the behavior of other characters, demonstrating her control over the digital environment.

Her interactions with Alice are intense and pivotal, offering dramatic encounters that highlight the power dynamics within DaSCHland.

He filters streams of queries, snatches fresh data before it cools, and insists that everyone else live as he does: in the fleeting moment of absolute relevance.

He joins every conversation without being invited, offering cryptic metrics and spontaneous insights that are half brilliant, half baffling. Much like his former self in Wonderland, his tea-time has been replaced by tick-time — a frenzy of milliseconds, pings, and push updates.

Often seen arguing with The Archived Node (a sleepy, lumbering bureaucrat), The Real-Time Processor believes in motion over meditation, precision over perspective, and speed over everything else.

The Algorithmic Duchess in DaSCHland oversees a segment of the digital landscape that mirrors her eclectic and somewhat chaotic household, where the laws of physics and conventional logic are frequently bent. Her interactions often include lessons about manners and morality, albeit delivered in a convoluted manner that challenges Alice to think critically about the rules and norms of both the real and digital worlds.

Her character is not only a caretaker of peculiar digital creatures but also serves as a critical voice in the narrative, pushing Alice to question and understand the underlying structures of DaSCHland.

The poem, titled “You Are Old, Father William,” is a humorous parody of a serious and moralistic poem by Robert Southey called “The Old Man’s Comforts and How He Gained Them.” (1799) by Romantic poet Robert Southey. In the original poem, Father William was a Christian minister whom reassured the speaking character to retain a faith in God when called into question by the main character due to the ailments of Father William's aging.

When reciting the poem to the Caterpillar, Alice misremembers the lyrics: 
A young man questions Father William about his strange behavior as an old man, including standing on his head, eating large quantities of food, and balancing eels on his nose. 
Father William responds with witty and nonsensical explanations, contrasting the original poem’s moral tone. ",,R_02,,"In DaSCHland, Metadata Custodian (the reimagined Father William) stands as the paradoxical elder statesman of information architecture, defying conventional wisdom about legacy systems. Once considered obsolete, Metadata Custodian performs impossible computational feats—standing on his head while processing inverted indexes, executing backflips through nested data structures, and balancing complex ontologies on the tip of his nose.

His advanced age in system-years has granted him root access to the deepest metadata layers, where creation timestamps and original author tags reside. When young programs challenge his methods as outdated, Metadata Custodian demonstrates that his ancient protocols can outperform modern algorithms through sheer experiential optimization. His white beard flows with cascading stylesheets, and his eyes gleam with the wisdom of countless version controls.

Her constant repetition isn't senility but optimization; she knows that saying something three times makes it cache properly. Data Repeater embodies the trade-off between storage efficiency and access speed, showing that sometimes repetition is not a bug but a feature.",Data Repeater,"I_070, I_071 ","Animals, Surrealism, Imagination, Contradiction, Fluidity of Space, Absurdity, Chaos","Noémi Villars-Amberg, Daniela Subotic"
CH_053,Lion,Löwe,Lion,Leone,"The Lion and Unicorn appear in Through the Looking-Glass.
 They are characters based on the traditional British nursery rhyme, symbolizing the heraldic symbols of England (the Lion) and Scotland (the Unicorn).

The Lion represents strength and England. He is described as fierce and powerful but a bit slow-witted.

The Lion and Unicorn are fighting over the crown, a playful depiction of the traditional rivalry between England and Scotland.
During their fight, they pause to eat plum cake, reflecting Carroll’s blend of nonsense and humor.

The scene satirizes political conflict in a whimsical way, with neither side gaining a real victory.",,R_02,,"In DaSCHland, Security Protocol (the reimagined Lion) prowls the system as the apex predator of access control, his mane a flowing firewall of golden authentication tokens. Unlike the aggressive Guardian of Data, Security Protocol operates with calm authority, knowing that his mere presence deters most intrusions. His roar is a system-wide authentication challenge that all processes must answer or face immediate termination.

His battle with the Unique Dataset (evolved from the Unicorn) over the crown represents the eternal conflict between security and accessibility—two forces that must be balanced but can never fully coexist. Security Protocol's approach is methodical: identify, authenticate, authorize, audit. His powerful paws can revoke access privileges with a single swipe, and his teeth can tear through the strongest encryption if he possesses the proper keys.

When he shares the plum-cake with Alice and Unique Dataset, it becomes a demonstration of resource allocation under security constraints—everyone gets their designated portion, no more, no less. His inability to catch the Unique Dataset represents the challenge of securing unique, one-off processes that don't fit standard security models. Security Protocol reminds DaSCHland that true security requires not just strength but wisdom in its application.",Security Protocol,I_078,"Authority, Judgment, Contradiction, Imagination, Paradoxes, Absurdity","Noémi Villars-Amberg, Daniela Subotic"

 They are characters based on the traditional British nursery rhyme, symbolizing the heraldic symbols of England (the Lion) and Scotland (the Unicorn).

The Unicorn represents Scotland. He is clever, sly, and proud, often boasting that he can defeat the Lion.

During their fight, they pause to eat plum cake, reflecting Carroll’s blend of nonsense and humor.

The scene satirizes political conflict in a whimsical way, with neither side gaining a real victory.",,R_02,,"In DaSCHland, Unique Dataset (the reimagined Unicorn) gallops through the system as a singular, unreplicatable collection of information that defies all attempts at normalization or categorization. Its spiral horn is a primary key generator that produces truly unique identifiers that can never be duplicated, even across parallel systems. Its silvery body shimmers with data points that exist nowhere else in the digital realm, making it both invaluable and impossible to back up.

The eternal conflict with Security Protocol represents the challenge of protecting unique data that cannot be verified against any other source. Unique Dataset's ability to believe in impossible things (like a human child in Looking-Glass world) translates to storing paradoxical data that shouldn't exist according to system schemas but does anyway.

When sharing the plum-cake, Unique Dataset demonstrates the difficulty of distributing indivisible resources—some data simply cannot be split without losing its essential uniqueness. Its legendary status in DaSCHland comes from being living proof that not everything needs redundancy; some data is valuable precisely because it exists only once. The mutual disbelief between Alice and Unique Dataset reflects the system's struggle to process truly unique information that fits no existing patterns.",Unique Dataset,I_078,"Authority, Judgment, Contradiction, Imagination, Paradoxes, Absurdity","Noémi Villars-Amberg, Daniela Subotic"
