Contrary to popular belief, Lewis Carroll never referred to the Hatter as 'the Mad Hatter' in the story. He simply called him 'the Hatter'.

He serves as a guide for Alice, offering riddles and cryptic advice but never direct answers.

The reason for Carroll naming this character 'Cheshire Cat' is unclear: 
'To grin like a Cheshire Cat' was a common phrase in Carroll's day. 
It may have originated from a sign painter in Cheshire who painted grinning lions on the sign-boards of inns in the area.
